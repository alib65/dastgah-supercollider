# dastgah-supercollider
Ali Balighi’s "Dastgah" (2024) synthesizes Persian theory and Western serialism via SuperCollider. Utilizing a 17-tone microtonal matrix inspired by Dastgah modes, it reimagines serial structures to produce an evolving, cross-cultural soundscape that explores complex pitch relationships and musical identity.
